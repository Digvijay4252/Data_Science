## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification

- **Decision Trees** – [Decision Tree Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/DecisionTree)
- **Random Forest** – [Random Forest Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/RandomForest)
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** – [SVM Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/SVM-Support-Vector-Machines-)
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** – [KNN Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/KNN)
- **Logistic Regression** – [Logistic Regression Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/Logistic_Regression)
- **Naive Bayes** – [Naive Bayes Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/Naive-Bayes)
- **Gradient Boosting** – [Gradient Boosting Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/Gradient-Boosting)

### 2. Regression

- **Linear Regression** – [Linear Regression Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/Linear-Regression)
- **Ridge Regression** – [Ridge Regression Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/Ridge-Regression)
- **Lasso Regression** – [Lasso Regression Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/Lasso-Regression)
- **Elastic Net Regression** – [Elastic Net Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/Elastic-Net-Regression)

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning uses **unlabeled data** to find patterns and relationships.

### 1. Clustering

- **K-Means** – [K-Means Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/Logistic_Regression)
- **Hierarchical Clustering** – [Hierarchical Clustering Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/Hierarchical_Clustering)
- **DBSCAN** – [DBSCAN Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/DBSCAN)

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – [PCA Repo](https://github.com/Digvijay4252/PCA)
